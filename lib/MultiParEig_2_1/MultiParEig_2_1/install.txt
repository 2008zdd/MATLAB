Installation the MultiParEig toolbox
---------------------------------------

1. Unpack the compressed file MultiParEig_2_1.zip. This should create
   a directory MultiParEig_2_1.

2. Open MATLAB and change into the directory MultiParEig_2_1.

3. Execute the following commands within Matlab

     addpath(pwd)
     cd examples; cd bdemep; addpath(pwd)
     savepath %<-- Save path for future MATLAB sessions.
              %    This may not work for all installations of Matlab.

Compatibility with MATLAB versions
----------------------------------

This toolbox requires MATLAB Version 8.0 (R2012b) or later. It has
been tested under Windows 7, with MATLAB Versions 8.0 (R2012b), and 8.5 (R2015a)

Other requierements
-------------------

Functions bde2mep and bde3mep require package Dmsuite by J.A.C. Weideman (or other chebdif method)
If you use MATLAB prior to Version 8.3 (R2014a), package lapack by T. Toolan is recommended for faster evaluation of twopareigs

Getting started
---------------

Run the function that start with demo_ in Examples subdirectories

Additional information
----------------------

This is a joined work with Andrej Muhiè, who wrote part of the code, among other things he contributed the staircase algorithm for a singular multiparameter eigenvalue problem.
