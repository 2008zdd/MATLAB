# MATLAB
Numerical methods and algorithms. Experimental.

Matlab programs covering the following areas:

* Numerical analysis
* Approximation theory
* Spectral Methods
* Integration
* Differential Equations
* Geometry


Key Features:

* Numerical linear algebra
* Rootfinders (NR, Muller, Laguerre)
* Polynomial operations (evaluation, arithmethic, composition, rootfinding)
* Quadrature rules (gualeg, gaucheb, gaulag, gauherm, clenshaw-curtis, 2D and 3D)
* Generalized Fourier Series (sine, cosine, Chebyshev, Legendre, spherical harmonics)
* Ordinary differential equations (Euler, Runge-Kutta)
* Partial differential equations (wave, heat, Navier-Stokes)
* Physical simulations (n-body)
